# correct this file \# PythonForCybersecurity_Part1

Learn fundamental Python concepts and apply them to cybersecurity tasks like log analysis and attack detection. Build a strong foundation for automating security monitoring while understanding key data protection principles.

Hey! Iâ€™m Vaibhavi, but you can call me Vai. Iâ€™m passionate about cybersecurity and always exploring simpler ways to solve complex problems. This repository is designed to guide you on how to kickstart your journey in Python programming effortlessly, with a focus on cybersecurity applications.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages due to its simplicity and versatility. This series, **Cybersecurity with Python**, covers the basics of Python along with its vital applications in cybersecurity. Youâ€™ll learn how to use Python for log analysis, identifying code vulnerabilities, and ensuring data accuracy while maintaining CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) properties in data transmission. The series also includes detection of brute-force attacks using network logs and automating incident response by sending alerts to the security team via email.

## 1. Print and Input Functions

### Print Function

The `print()` function outputs data to the console. It can display strings, numbers, variables, or multiple items together.

- Printing a string
```print("Hello, world!")```
- Printing a number
```print(123)```

-Printing a variable
```x = 42 print(x)```

- Printing multiple items

```name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)```

text

### Input Function

The `input()` function collects user input. It shows an optional message, waits for the user to type input, and returns it as a string. To use input as other types, convert it explicitly.

Get user input as a string
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

text

---

## 2. Variables and Data Types

Variables store data values without needing explicit types. Python assigns types automatically based on values. Common data types include:

- **Integer (int):** Whole numbers like `123`, `-123`, `0`  
- **Float:** Numbers with decimals like `3.14`, `-0.001`  
- **String:** Sequences of characters like `"Hello, world!"`  
- **Boolean:** Logical values `True` or `False`

Defining variables
name = "Alice" # String
iq = 140 # Integer
height = 5.6 # Float
is_student = True # Boolean

Checking types
print(type(name))
print(type(iq))
print(type(height))
print(type(is_student))

text

---

## 3. Operations

### 3.1 Comparison Operators

Return Boolean results by comparing values.

print(x == y) # Equal to
print(x != y) # Not equal to
print(x > y) # Greater than
print(x < y) # Less than
print(x >= y) # Greater than or equal to
print(x <= y) # Less than or equal to

text

### 3.2 Logical Operators

Combine Boolean conditions.

```a = True
b = False
print(a and b) # Logical AND
print(a or b) # Logical OR
print(not a) # Logical NOT```

text

### 3.3 Assignment Operators

Assign or modify variable values.

```x = 10
y = 15
x += 5 # x = x + 5
x *= 2 # x = x * 2
y -= 3 # y = y - 3

print(x)
print(y)```

text

---

## 4. Loops

### for Loop

Iterates over sequences or ranges.

```for i in range(5):
print(i)```

text

### while Loop

Repeats as long as a condition is true.

```count = 0
while count < 5:
print(count)
count += 1```

text

---

## 5. If Statements

Execute code conditionally with `if`, optional `elif`, and `else`.

```x = 10

if x > 5:
print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
print("x is equal to 5")
else:
print("x is less than 5")```

text

---

## 6. Functions

Reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks.

```def greet(name):
return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))```

text

---

## 7. Collections in Python

### 7.1 Lists `[ ]`

Ordered, mutable sequences.

```fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits) # Access first element
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)```

text

### 7.2 Tuples `( )`

```Ordered, immutable sequences.

coordinates = (1, "hello", 3.14, True)
print(coordinates)```

text

### 7.3 Sets `{ }`

Unordered collections of unique items.

```unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3}
print(unique_numbers) # Outputs: {1, 2, 3}```

text

### 7.4 Dictionaries `{ Key: Value }`

```Unordered key-value pairs.

student = {"name": "Rambika", "age": 21}
print(student["name"])```

text

---

## 8. File Handling

### 8.1 Reading a File

```a = open("Logfile.txt", "r")
print(a.read())
a.close()```

text

Reading line-by-line:

```with open("Logfile.txt", "r") as b:
for line in b:
print(line.strip())```

text

### 8.2 Writing to a File

```f = open("Logfile.txt", "a")
f.write("\n172.16.22.11 445 SMB file access")
f.close()```

```Reading after appending
with open("Logfile.txt", "r") as f:
print(f.read())```

text

### 8.3 Using Regular Expressions

```import re

text = "Name: John, Age: 30"
name = re.search(r"Name: (.?),", text).group(1)
age = re.search(r"Age: (.)", text).group(1)
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")```

text

### 8.4 Reading File Line By Line with `split()`

Split lines into lists by delimiter (default space).

```with open("Logfile.txt", "r") as file:
for line in file:
words = line.strip().split()
print(words)```
